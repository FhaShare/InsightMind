## Project Vision
InsightMind is an interactive application designed to promote mental health awareness and self-assessment. This educational project leverages the DASS-21 and DASS-42 questionnaires to evaluate levels of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress. The project aims to empower users with insights into their mental well-being through a user-friendly graphical interface and intuitive result visualization.

## Features
  1. Mental Health Self-Assessment:
      - Incorporates DASS-21 and DASS-42 questionnaires.
      - Classifies mental health levels into five categories: Normal, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Extremely Severe.
  2. Interactive GUI:
      - Built using Pygame for an intuitive, visually engaging experience.
      - Features responsive buttons, custom backgrounds, and smooth navigation.
  3. Data Visualization:
      - Employs Matplotlib to generate radar charts for a better understanding of results.
  4. Encouraging Feedback:
      - Includes a Random Quote Generator displaying positive affirmations post-assessment.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations
This project uses the DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales) questionnaires strictly for educational purposes. These tools are in the public domain and freely available for non-commercial use, including research and personal projects.

Attribution: “The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) were developed by Prof. Peter Lovibond and Prof. Sidney Lovibond, University of New South Wales, Australia.”

Disclaimer: InsightMind is a self-assessment tool and does not replace professional diagnosis or treatment. Users are encouraged to seek medical advice if results indicate high levels of depression, anxiety, or stress.

## Challenges, Incomplete Features, and Lessons Learned
  1. Technical Challenges:
      - Implementing dynamic radar charts for visualization.
      - Manage image assets and optimize GUI performance.
  2. Incomplete Features:
      - The program is currently incomplete, specifically the graph display for game results.
      - To address this, we plan to integrate matplotlib.pyplot in future updates to create accurate and visually appealing graph visualizations.
  3. Lessons Learned:
      - Effective communication and task delegation are key in collaborative projects.
      - Testing iteratively ensures a smoother user experience.
  4. Future Improvements:
      - Enhance result visualizations for greater clarity.
      - Add multilingual support to broaden accessibility.
